How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Sufficient testing is a great way to ensure that a product is functional and secure. There are various methods of testing that can be performed throughout the development cycle such as the unit testing that we primarily focused on in this course. This includes testing particular sections of code to ensure that they function correctly and handle any user input they may receive appropriately.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Requirements documents are a great way to ensure user needs are understand and incorporated in the program. Discussing what the vision a client has with them can be a good starting point to establishing a requirements document to track functionalities and any specifications or design choices they may want incorporated into the program.

How do I approach designing software?

I use the requirements document as a functional outline of what functionalities need to be included in the software. From there I break down how Classes and Methods will be organized to sufficiently cover all of the requirements. Finally, if there are any specific requirements that may change how a Class or Method would be set up, I will make note of those as I move through the development process. Finally, it is important to test functionalities both, as I develop them, as well as after the fact. In addition, it is important to ensure that any intermingling that Classes or Methods perform are also functional.
